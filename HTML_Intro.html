    It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see,
    and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to
    the user.</p>

    <p><em>Whatever is between the opening tag and the closing tag is called an element</em>. Let's create some...</p>
    In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in an &lt;h1&gt; tag.
    And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.
